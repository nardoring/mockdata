* Mock Data Lake

This repo will house our mock data for use in the Data Lake

You will want to run the following command once this has been added as a git submodule to =./infra/=

#+begin_src shell
cd infra/mockdata
git update-index --assume-unchanged metadata/requests.json
#+end_src

This will essentially stop tracking changes of =requests.json=.
